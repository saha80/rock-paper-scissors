generalized rock-paper-scissors game (any number of arbitrary combinations).
When the program starts, an odd number of non-repeating lines is transferred.
These lines are moves (for example, Rock Paper Scissors or Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock or 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9).

Victory is defined as follows - the sequence of the next wins in the circle, half of the previous ones in the circle lose (the semantics of the lines is not important, in which the user entered, and plays in that).
A random key with a length of 128 bits is generated, the computer does, the HMAC is calculated from its move, the HMAC is shown.
The script shows who won, the turn of the computer and the original key. This way, you can check that the computer is playing fair (did not change its move after your move).
